By default
.B innoextract
will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable or disable color output accordingly. Pass \fB1\fP or \fBtrue\fP to \fB--color\fP to force color output. Pass \fB0\fP or \fBfalse\fP to never output color codes.
.TP
.B --dump
Don't convert Windows paths to UNIX paths and don't substitute variables in paths.
.TP

Extract all files to the current directory. This is the default action. You may only specify one of \fB--extract\fP, \fB--list\fP and \fB--test\fP.
.TP
.B \-h --help
Show a list of the supported options.
.TP
.B \--language LANG
Extract only language-independent files and files for the given language. By default all files are extracted.

.TP
.B \-L --lowercase
Convert filenames stored in the installer to lower-case before extracting.
.TP
.B \-p --progress[=ENABLE]
By default \fBinnoextract\fP will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable or disable progress bar output accordingly. Pass \fB1\fP or \fBtrue\fP to \fB--progress\fP to force progress bar output. Pass \fB0\fP or \fBfalse\fP to never show a progress bar.
.TP
.B \-q --quiet
Less verbose output.
.TP
.B \-s --silent
Don't output anything except errors and warnings.
.TP
.B \-t --test
Test archive integrity but don't write any output files. You may only specify one of \fB--extract\fP, \fB--list\fP and \fB--test\fP.
.TP
.B \-v --version
Show the \fBinnoextract\fP version number and supported Inno Setup versions.
.SH EXIT VALUES
.PP
.IP \fB0\fP
Success
.IP \fB1\fP
Syntax or usage error
.IP \fB2+\fP
Broken or unsupported setup file
.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBinnoextract\fP currently only supports extracting all the data. There is no support for extracting individual files or components and limited support for extracting language-specific files.

Included scripts and checks are not executed.

Data is always extracted to the current directory and the mapping from Inno Setup variables like the application directory to subdirectories is hard-coded.

\fBinnoextract\fP does not check if an installer includes multiple files with the same name and will continually overwrite the destination file when extracting.

Names for data files in multi-file installers must follow the standard naming scheme.

Encrypted installers are not supported.
